====================================

Big Blank theme is a blank responsive theme for WordPress, with semantic HTML5 code and a very minimal CSS styling. This is not a naked or barebone theme, but a clean starting boilerplate for a more complex theme development. It makes development of complex themes easier. Sometimes you don't want to start your theme development from scratch. This is where this minimalistic blank and responsive WordPress theme comes in. Most of the necessary styles that don't matter much are provided, such as comments, forms, and regular styling of common elements such as headings, image alignments, etc... However, the rest of the layout has a very minimal styling, so you could start developing your own theme.
